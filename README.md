A mobile app, developed with React Native, to help students of the University of Ottawa find their classes on campus.

This app is currently in progress. You can follow its progress here, view some screenshots below, or look in `design` for some Illustrator files where many designs of the app exist.

While the app is in development, all of the data collected about the University of Ottawa, the courses, and the buildings, will be kept in a separate repository. When the app is released, expect that data to be documented and open sourced alongside this application.
